# Ley Lines

Ley lines /leɪ laɪnz/ :
 apparent alignments of places of significance in the geography or culture of an area, often including man-made structures. They are in the older sense, ancient, straight trackways in the landscape, or in the newer sense, spiritual and mystical alignments.

## Project question
  What are the lines that brought all of us together at Epicodus?

## Technologies
  * Google Maps API with Directions Service
  * Ruby 2.2.2
  * Rails 5.1.2
  * D3.js (beyond MVP)

## Let's talk MVP
  * implement Google Maps API direction services
  * hard code end location
  * first, display a single route on the map from hard coded data
  * then... take dynamic data for start location and display that route

## MVP ✔️ what's beyond?
  * visually represent overlaps/intersections
  * visually represent routes based off mode of transportation
  * extract route lines from the map and do cool D3 magic ☄️
  * Explore Deck GL
  * Explore Encoded Polyline Algorithm https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm
  * allow for generation of visualization based off dynamic data, with original hard coded data as example output
