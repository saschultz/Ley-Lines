## Technologies
  * Google Maps API
  * Ruby 2.2.2
  * Rails 5.1.2
  * D3.js (beyond MVP)

## Let's talk MVP
  * implement Google Maps API direction services
  * hard code central location
  * first, display a single route on the map from hard coded data
  * then... display multiple routes on the same map from hard coded data
  * visually represent overlaps/intersections

## MVP ✔️ what's beyond?
  * visually represent routes based off mode of transportation
  * extract route lines from the map and do cool D3 sh!t
  * allow for generation of visualization based off dynamic data, with original hard coded data as example output
